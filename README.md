# AlphaMemo — AI Research Copilot

> **AI 405 - AI Impacts and Applications | Final Project**
> **Author:** Pitchanan Lohavanichbutr
> **Bellevue College | March 2026**

An educational AI application that combines market price data, financial headlines,
and technical features to generate structured investment research memos and
practice-trading signals. Built as a class project for an AI Ethics course.

> ⚠️ **This is an educational prototype for practice trading and research only.
> It is not investment advice and does not place live trades.**

## How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set your API key (optional — app works without it)
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
# OR enter it directly in the app sidebar
```

### 3. Start the app
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## What it does

1. **Fetches real stock price data** via Yahoo Finance (yfinance)
2. **Loads recent news headlines** from Yahoo Finance
3. **Computes technical signals** — momentum, moving averages, volatility, volume
4. **Generates a structured research summary** — using Claude API if a key is provided, otherwise a transparent rule-based formula
5. **Simulates historical strategy performance** with trading fee assumptions
6. **Displays results** in a Streamlit dashboard with plain-English explanations

## Ethical Safeguards

- ✅ Practice mode only — no real money or live trading
- ✅ Cannot buy or sell real stocks
- ✅ AI confidence limited to 85% maximum to prevent overconfidence
- ✅ Trading fees included in all simulated results
- ✅ Signals use previous day's data to prevent look-ahead bias
- ✅ Analysis method always disclosed (Claude AI vs basic formula)
- ✅ All AI decisions explained in plain English (Explainable AI)
- ✅ Works for any stock — no favorites or bias toward specific tickers
- ✅ Prominent disclaimers on every page

## Known Limitations

- News headlines from Yahoo Finance may include general market news, not only company-specific news
- Sentiment keyword list (basic mode) was manually defined — not statistically trained
- The ±2 signal threshold and 45% confidence baseline are design choices, not optimized values
- Price data may be delayed up to 15 minutes
- Company data availability varies for small-cap stocks
